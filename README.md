## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Smart-HeatPump-IoT is a cloud-connected heat pump monitoring and control system built using Raspberry Pi, MQTT, BLE/Modbus RTU, and cloud services (AWS IoT/Firebase). It enables real-time temperature monitoring, remote control, and OTA firmware updates for predictive maintenance.

âœ… Monitor temperature, compressor status, and energy usage remotely.
âœ… Send control commands via a web dashboard (turn heat pump ON/OFF).
âœ… Secure MQTT communication with TLS encryption.
âœ… OTA firmware updates for remote device management.
